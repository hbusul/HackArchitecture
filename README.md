# HackArchitecture

A VHDL Implementation of Hack Architecture described in Nand2Tetris Course.
  - Tests require GHDL to run.
  - To test implemented components, use "./runTests.sh". Windows version for script is not available yet, however you can implement it easily.
  - Some components' names are not same with the course's names because of name conflict with VHDL keywords such as BitHolder(Bit), Reg16(Register).
